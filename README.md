<p>
Add following files to run app and gce backend:
<ul>
    <li>app/google-services.json</li>
    <li>gce/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/serviceAccountKey.json</li>
</ul>
Both files can be downloaded from Firebase console.
Beware all versions of app (free and paid) should be added to firebase console in order to receive FCM messages.
